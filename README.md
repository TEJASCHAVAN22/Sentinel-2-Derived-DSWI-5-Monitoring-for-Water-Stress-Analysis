# Sentinel-2-Derived-DSWI-5-Monitoring-for-Water-Stress-Analysis
Sentinel-2 derived DSWI-5 is used to monitor water stress by analyzing spectral differences between vegetation-sensitive and water-sensitive bands. This index helps detect early plant stress, evaluate crop health, and support agricultural water management by providing timely, high-resolution spatial insights.
